response_text: "Successfully updated the project constitution from version 1.2.0 to 2.0.0. The update introduces a new evolutionary approach with clearly defined Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced levels. A new core principle (Forward-Compatible Architecture) was added to emphasize future-proofing. The constitution now includes explicit feature progression paths, planned command sets for future levels, and updated constraints to reflect the project's evolutionary nature. This is a major version bump due to the significant architectural and structural changes."
outcome: "Constitution updated to version 2.0.0 with new evolutionary approach and feature progression paths."
evaluation: "Version bump from 1.2.0 to 2.0.0 is appropriate as this introduces significant new structural elements and a new core principle. The constitution now clearly defines the project's evolutionary path from Basic to Advanced levels."
